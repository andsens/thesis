  abstract = {A form-based service is one in which the flow of data
		 between service and user is described by a sequence of
		 query/response interactions, or forms. Mawl is a
		 domain-specific language for programming form-based
		 services in a device-independent manner. We focus on
		 Mawl's form abstraction, which is the means for
		 separating service logic from user interface
		 description, and show how this simple abstraction
		 addresses seven issues in service creation, analysis,
		 and maintenance: compile-time guarantees,
		 implementation flexibility, rapid prototyping, testing
		 and validation, support for multiple devices,
		 composition of services, and usage analysis.},
