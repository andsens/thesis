I want to thank my family, ex-girlfriend and friends for the understanding and
support they offered me throughout the writing of this thesis.

The original idea for this concept originated in some intriguing conversations
with Casper Bach Poulsen, without whom the proverbial light bulb may never have
lit up above my head; Thank you.

A lot of the novel practices used in this thesis can be attributed to the
thriving work environment at my employer, Secoya.
Thank you to all my colleagues at work who challenge the status quo and always
push to try out the new and shiny things.

I thank my friends from university
Martin, Steffen, Ubbe, Jens Christian, Peter and Casper
for the great times we had during our studies and the even greater times
between them.

Finally I extend my sincere gratitude to Jan Midtgaard, my advisor,
who provided me with stellar feedback and went far beyond the call of duty to
help me see this through to the end. Without him, this thesis may never have
seen the light of day.
