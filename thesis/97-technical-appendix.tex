\section{Choosing the tools}
Existing frameworks supply much of the functionality we require.
\begin{itemize}
\item requirejs to get the information about placeholder locations to the client.
\item as in the prototype: backbone to represent client models,
	collections and views
\item chaplin to supply us with a framework. Chaplin is very lightweight and
	utilizes backbone. It comes with controllers and extended views and adds
	collectionviews
\item handlebars is a port of mustache templates to the client side
\item coffeescript to avoid all the javascript nonsense
\item HaXML to parse html templates
\item Parsec to combine HaXML and a custom parser for mustache templates
\end{itemize}
