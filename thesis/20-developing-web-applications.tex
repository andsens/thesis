\chapter{Developing web applications}
\label{chap:webapps}
Web applications are on the rise. Not a day goes by where a new
web application isn't popping up for uses that were previously reserved for a
program locally installed on a computer. Even more so: Previously
unimagined uses for any Internet enabled device seem to be developed
at a rate that surpasses the former.

\section{The structure of web applications}
\subsection{Synchronous and asynchronous communication}
Any web application can be divided into a server part and a client part.
Mostly both parts play a role in providing functionality to a web application.
The server holds persistent data in order for the user to be able to connect
from any machine. Since the server is not in the same location as the
client machine, latency in responses to user actions are a problem.
Diagram \ref{fig:synchronous} illustrates what such an interplay between client
and server looks like.

	\label{fig:synchronous}
\end{figure}

The client uses the web application to enter data, this we will
call user activity. Once the user issues a command that requires data from the
server, the web application issues a request to the server and halts any further
execution until the server has responded.
Once the client receives a response, it continues execution
where it left off and the user can continue interacting with the web application.
This is called a synchronous communication. The client acts in
synchronicity with the server and does not act independently from the server.
The higher the latency of the response, the longer the user has to wait to
interact with the web application again.
Such waiting periods are undesirable as, it results in a loss of productivity
and user-friendliness.

This challenge is solved by letting the client part of the web application
continue to compute responses when information on the server is not required.
Queries to the server can then happen asynchronously, meaning a function can
define a callback function which is invoked once the response is available. This
is called asynchronous communication; the client continues execution after it
has sent off a request to the server. Once the server responds, a function on
the client will be invoked to handle that response.
Asynchronous communication allows the user to continue to interact with the
web application. Diagram \ref{fig:asynchronous} shows how user activity can
take place, while the server computes a response to a previously issued request.

\subsection{JavaScript alternatives}
\label{sec:javascript-alts}
In this thesis, we will focus on web applications which use a
modern web browser and with it HTML as their basis (HTML5 in particular).
The non-static parts, which control the heart of the web application,
are supplied by JavaScript. This not only includes interactivity, but also
animation and updates from the server.
Interactivity in this context is defined as anything in the web application
the user can modify directly via an input device or modify indirectly, e.g.,
the back button in the browser and the window size of the browser.

Alternatives to JavaScript like Dart, CoffeeScript and Google Web Toolkit
do exist and are meant to ameliorate the shortcomings of JavaScript. 
However, they are all translated into JavaScript if cross-browser
compatibility is a requirement (which it almost always is).

\subsection{Server-side web applications}
A web application can incorporate business logic and interactivity by rendering
customized HTML pages solely on the server.
Rendering the HTML entirely on the server can be advantageous in a number of
situations:
\begin{itemize}
	\label{list:server-side-arguments}
	\item \emph{Heavy computations can be run in a controllable time frame
	regardless of the client device.}\\
		Especially phones and other portable devices have reduced computing
		capacity in order to save battery power.
	\item \emph{Sensitive data can be handled without leaking it to the
	client.}\\
		Any data that the client is not supposed to see, can never leave the
		server. This means if any computation on the data should take place,
		it would have to be made insensitive, e.g., in the case of personal data
		for statistical purposes, the data would have to be anonymized first.
	\item \emph{The client application has to be initialized with data for each
	page load.}\\
		Data that gives the application context, is -- depending on the language
		and implementation -- loaded in RAM and/or saved in a database. On the
		client this data would first have to be loaded either from the server or
		from the local storage.
	\item \emph{The technology stack is more controllable.}\\
		The main browser technology stack, i.e., CSS, HTML and JavaScript,
		has suffered greatly under the ``browser wars'' \todo{reference}
		and has only gained widespread standardization in the last 5 years.
		There are still many inconsistencies, especially when tackling edge cases
		(for example the ``Guillotine bug'' in Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 and 7,
		each with their own variation\footnote{\url{http://www.positioniseverything.net/explorer/guillotine.html}}).
		This technology stack and its edge cases is greatly reduced when
		the application runs on the server, because every software version and
		the software itself can be controlled by the developer.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Client-side web applications}
Web applications can also be developed solely using client-side code,
leaving the server to only supply static content.
``Mashups'' are fitting examples of such an approach.
These web applications rely on external JavaScript APIs
(Google Maps, Twitter, Weather services) to combine readily available in new
ways. The client browser requests and combines this data without interacting
with the server. These external APIs retrieve their data from servers of course,
but those servers are not maintained by the developer and are exposed to neither
the user nor the developer.

As with the server-side only approach, the client-side only approach has some
exclusive advantages.

\begin{itemize}
	\label{list:client-side-arguments}
	\item \emph{Low server load}\\
	The server needs only serve static content. For most web applications,
	all of that content fits into the RAM, allowing fast response times and
	scalability.
	\item \emph{Accountability}\\
	When handling data sensitive to the user, the ability to audit the code that
	handles the data removes the necessity to trust the provider of the
	web application. Provided the client-side code is not obfuscated every
	operation can be audited by a third party or the user himself\footnote{An
		example of such an application is \emph{Strongcoin}, an online wallet
		for BitCoins. The code is not compressed or obfuscated in any way, allowing
		the user to audit the code.
	}.
	\item \emph{Portability}\\
	To run a web application, which relies on communication with a server,
	requires an Internet connection. A client-side only web application does,
	in some cases, not have that requirement. The browser can store all the code
	that is necessary to run the web application, provided that no data from other
	services is necessary, the user can open the web application without an
	Internet connection and still use it\footnote{Google's GMail email service
		for example can be accessed in Google Chrome
		without an Internet connection in a limited fashion.
	}.
\end{itemize}

JavaScript is of course not the only way to create interactive web applications.
Technologies like Java Applets and Adobe Flash have existed for a long time and
made their impression upon the world wide web. We will not use those
technologies for anything in this thesis. They will not be included
in any comparisons or alternatives.

\subsection{Combining the strengths}
The arguments from
\ref{list:client-side-arguments} and \ref{list:server-side-arguments}
do not make the case for either approach to construct a web application.
They instead highlight the strengths of both.
A combination of server-side and client-side processing where their respective
advantages are utilized and their drawbacks avoided, will help in creating
responsive and maintainable web applications.
An example of that would be guessing server responses:\\
Often lag between action from the user and response from the server cannot be
avoided. Instead, asynchronous communication allows the interface to stay
responsive. The client-side code can then guess what the result from the server
will be and update the interface accordingly.
Later it can correct any discrepancies between the guess and the actual
response from the server.

A simple example is the deletion of an item from a list: Once a user has given
the command to delete an item, the client sends a request to the
server to perform the deletion. This can be a file, folder or an address from an
address book. The client does in such a case not need to wait for the server to
respond to remove this item from the view, it can do so immediately.
This increases the felt performance of an application for the user.
If the deletion did not succeed (e.g. the user has insufficient rights,
the address does not exist any longer, the folder is not empty),
the client can upon receival of the error reintroduce the item into the list and
notify the user of the error.
A drawback of such a strategy is an interruption of the work flow,
where the user may already be working on another task.
It must therefore be applied only when the interrupted work flow is a price
worth paying (e.g. interface responsiveness is paramount, errors rarely happen). 

\section{The development process}
The development process of a web application is similar to most
software development processes. One starts with the data to be modeled.
It may be developed for the client and server part simultaneously.
A protocol for communication between the two is then established.
The design of a web application is usually the last component to fall
into place. It may have existed in the very beginning of the development
process, but is usually only finished and implemented when most other critical
components are in place.

\subsection{Usual design patterns}
Design patterns help developers to organize software projects into agreed upon
components, where each component has a specific function
(also referred to as ``concerns'' or ``responsibility'').
Although their exact features may not be known when a developer is first
introduced to a new software project, design patterns help him to quickly
recognize where functionality may be located in the code.

Instead of requiring developers to think up new structures, Design patterns
also help developers with grouping new code into well known components.

We will focus on one specific design pattern in this thesis. There many others,
which are relevant in web application development. There is nonetheless one
prevalent design pattern which we will examine in the following.

\subsubsection{Model-View-Controller}
The Model-View-Controller design pattern has proven itself to be a sane
choice for developing web applications. Most frameworks today use this
pattern or variations thereof.
It lends itself very well to web applications because of the client server
model, components of this pattern can be present on both sides allowing the
structure to be homogeneous.

\begin{itemize}
	\item The ``Model'' part represents the ``data''. All dynamic parts of an
	application modify, create or delete data, however ephemeral this data may
	be. Since much of the data can grouped, because it belongs to the same
	entity, it makes sense to represent those entities in the code and
	attach the data to them. This constitutes a Model. Besides this data,
	the Model can also have functions attached to it, which can act upon the data
	in various ways.
	\item A ``Controller'' implements the business logic that is decoupled from one
	specific Model. It draws on the functions tied to the models to perform its
	duties. Both of these components may be present on the server as well
	as the client.
	\item This is true for the ``View'' component as well. Its purpose however only
	comes to fruition on the client. This component is present on both the server
	and the client. Any HTML the server sends to the client is considered part of
	the ``View'' component.\\
	The job of the ``View'' component is to present the data to the user and
	tie calls to the controller to elements of the interface that can be acted
	upon by the user.
\end{itemize}

Designs of web applications change with time, features are added or
removed and common processes simplified. In light of this, it is
desirable to ensure that the ``View'' part of the Model-View-Controller
pattern is easily modifiable.

Modifications of this pattern have evolved in the web application domain to
cater to this specific purpose. The most notable of those would be the
Model-View-ViewModel pattern. It was designed by Microsoft and targeted at
interface development platforms including Windows Presentation Foundation and
Silverlight but also HTML5.
\todo{reference to MVVM from Microsoft, MVP by Taligent (Apple, IBM, HP)}

The ``ViewModel'' component allows developers to implement interface logic that
lies between the Model and the View, allowing the view to be entirely free
of code. This component is meant to hold data-bindings to the Model while
listening to interface events at the same time. It ``translates'' user actions
into operations on the Model. Without it, the view would have to be aware of how
data is laid out internally, making refactoring of code harder.

The advantage of this version of Model-View-Controller is the improved
separation of responsibility between interface developers and application
developers. Neither will be required to modify or thoroughly understand the code
of the other. Even if both roles are filled by the same person,
separation of responsibility in an application still has its merits.
