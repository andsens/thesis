\chapter{Architecture}
\label{chap:architecture}

Our goal is to create a tool that allows the developer to pass a rendered
template (DOM) to it and receive a data structure that equates the original
dataset passed to the template engine.
Parsing can be a process that requires a lot of processing power. We do not want
our tool to slow down the web application every time a new template is rendered
and the values are retrieved on the client. To minimize the effort required to
parse a rendered template we try to compile as much information about a template
as possible before it is rendered. Using this information we should be able
to parse a rendered template more quickly.
This strategy implies a pre-parsing step that outputs data which aids
the client library in the parsing process. Since this is an operation
that only needs to be run once before a web application is deployed, we are not
constrained by the environment the actual web server runs in.

\section{Compiling template information}
\label{sec:arch-comp-tpl}
We need to be able to parse a mustache template and acquire the necessary
information to enable the client library to parse a rendered template.
We analyze the capabilities of the mustache template language and arrive
at the following pieces of information, which we can deduce before
the template is rendered.

\begin{itemize}
\item The location of variables in the document
\item Whether a variable is escaped or unescaped
      (\inline{\{\{identifier\}\}} vs. \inline{\{\{\{identifier\}\}\}})
\item The location of sections in the document
\item Whether a section is inverted
      (\inline{\{\{\#identifier\}\}} vs. \inline{\{\{^identifier\}\}})
\item The contents of a section
\item The location of partials in the document
\item The location of comments in the document
\end{itemize}

Because of the nature of mustache templates we can however not retrieve the
following data:

\begin{itemize}
\item The contents of variables (including their type, e.g. integer, string)
\item The number of iterations a section will run
\item Whether a section is a loop or an if block
      (except in the case of an inverted section)
\item Whether a section is a lambda section or an actual section.
\item The behavior of a lambda section
\item The template a partial points at
\item Whether an identifier refers to a key in the current context level or
      to a key in one of the lower context levels\footnote{
            Except if we are located at the root level}
\end{itemize}

The rendered template is in the Document Object Model format, once it has
been rendered by the client. We can still access the rendered template as a
string after it has been inserted by accessing the \inline{innerHTML} property
on the element node it was inserted into. This has one major drawback.
The browser does not return the actual string that was inserted but rather a
serialized version of the DOM. This is demonstrated quite easily by executing
the following lines in the Google Chrome Developer Console:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=HTML]
var div = document.createElement("div")
div.innerHTML = "<img/>"
div.innerHTML
\end{lstlisting}

The last line does not return the string ``\ <img/\ >'' but ``\ <img\ >''.
In Firefox the last line returns ``\ <img xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" /\ >''.
This means that the rendered templates cannot be parsed reliably by using the
\inline{innerHTML} property.

However, no matter which way the browser decides to represent an HTML tag,
we can still rely on the ordering of tags and on the names of tags to be the same
(case sensitivity can be avoided with a simple
\inline{element.tagName.toLowerCase()} when comparing tag names client-side).
We therefore opt to relate the information about mustache tags to the DOM instead.

This choice requires our pre-parsing tool to be able to understand
HTML documents and construct a data structure resembling the DOM in which the
mustache tags can be located and their location converted into a DOM path.

\section{Communicating with the client}

The information gathered by the pre-parser is saved in files next to the
original templates. The developer may choose whatever technology fits best to
transfer this information to the client library. All the library should expect
is a DOM node with the rendered template as its children and the information
created by our pre-parser.
By choosing this approach we leave the developer with many optimization
possibilities.
\begin{itemize}
\item Gzip templates and template information statically to optimize
      server performance.
\item Prepend template information to the template and subsequently
      cut it out before passing the template to the template engine.
      This way only one file needs to be handled and transferred.
\item Use require-js to load templates and their information in parallel
      while developing and subsequently inline both template and
      template information into one big JavaScript file when deploying.
\end{itemize}

Figure \ref{fig:architecture} illustrates our resulting architecture.
We use the pre-parser tool to analyze the templates and save the results in new
files. The pre-parser can analyze the templates on any given machine before
both the templates and the results are deployed to the server. Together they
are part of the static content (among CSS, images etc.) of a web application.
The data is fed into the mustache template engine on a page request to generate
HTML that is served to the client. Once on the client, the HTML is parsed and we
can access it via the Document Object Model. The parser in our client library
uses the DOM in concert with the template information retrieved from the server
to parse the rendered template and outputs the data that was originally fed into
the template engine.

\section{Alternatives}

Instead of using a pre-parser, we could also take other paths to help
the client library in parsing rendered templates.

\subsection{Integrating with the template engine}

In chapter \ref{chap:requirements} we touched upon the fact that it was really
the template engine that discarded the information and only outputted the
rendered template. We could choose to modify the template engine to output that
exact information. This poses a rather big challenge:
For mustache templates there exists no such thing as \emph{the} template engine.
Currently the mustache website lists mustache engines in 29 different
programming languages\footnote{
      \url{https://github.com/defunkt/mustache/wiki/Other-Mustache-implementations/9ff07950f0983b58248e6a18d17cce5c47743344}
}.
This fact makes the goal of such an approach very hard to achieve.

\subsection{Decorating templates}

The developer could decorate mustache template tags with specific HTML tags that
have no effect on the visual layout but can be retrieved by the library.
This would make the client-side code a very lightweight value retriever
thereby obsoleting the pre-parser.

Apart from simply shifting the workload of locating template variables
from the ViewModel maintainer to the template maintainer\footnote{The scenario
in chapter \ref{chap:requirements} illustrates this point},
the task of retrofitting existing web applications becomes much greater.

\subsection{Rule of Parsimony}

The Rule of Parsimony states
\begin{citequote}{\cite[Chapter 1]{UXART}}
Rule of Parsimony: Write a big program only when it is clear by demonstration
that nothing else will do.
\end{citequote}

By examining the output of the \inline{innerHTML} property in different browsers
and hypothesizing\footnote{though not really``demonstrating'' in terms of
implementation} how our goal could be solved by decorating templates,
we have shown ``that nothing else will do''.
The approach to parse rendered templates after analyzing them may be are
more complex operation than other solutions, but it is the only one
``that will do'' to achieve our goal. We have also shown that integrating
directly with the template engine would in fact result in a bigger program.
We are therefore following The Rule of Parsimony.
