\chapter{Developing web applications}
web applications are on the rise. Not a day goes by where a new
web application isn't popping up for uses that were previously reserved for a
program locally installed on a computer. Even more so: Previously
unimagined uses for any Internet enabled device seem to be developed
at a rate that surpasses the former.

\section{What are web applications?}
In this thesis, we will focus on web applications which use a
modern web browser and with it HTML as their basis (HTML5 in particular).
The non-static parts, which control the heart of the web application,
are supplied by JavaScript. This not only includes interactivity, but also
animation and updates from the server.\\
Interactivity in this context is defined as anything in the web application
the user can modify directly via an input device or modify indirectly, e.g.,
the back button in the browser and the window size of the browser.

Alternatives to JavaScript like Dart, CoffeeScript and Google Web Toolkit
do exist and are meant to ameliorate the shortcomings of JavaScript. 
However, they are all translated into JavaScript if cross-browser
compatibility is a requirement (which it almost always is).

The claim that web applications are meant to be ubiquitous,
operating system independent and run in the browser, is not a claim shared
by all definitions of a web application. For simplicity however we will for the
remainder of this thesis treat it as fact.

\subsection{Server side web applications}
Another way to incorporate business logic \todo{definition} and
interactivity into a web application, is by rendering customized HTML pages
on the server.\\
This has both advantages and disadvantages to the client-side scripting method:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{Heavy computations can be run in a controllable time frame
	regardless of the client device.}\\
		Especially phones and other portable devices have reduced computing
		capacity in order to save battery power.
	\item \emph{Sensitive data can be handled without leaking it to the
	client.}\\
		Any data that the client is not supposed to see, can never leave the
		server. This means if any computation on the data should take place,
		it would have to be made insensitive, e.g., in the case of personal data
		for statistical purposes, the data would have to be anonymized first.
	\item \emph{The client application has to be initialized with data for each
	page load.}\\
		Data that gives the application context, is -- depending on the language
		and implementation -- loaded in RAM and/or saved in a database. On the
		client this data would first have to be loaded either from the server or
		from the local storage.
	\item \emph{The technology stack is more controllable.}\\
		The main browser technology stack, i.e., CSS, HTML and JavaScript,
		has suffered greatly under the "browser wars" \todo{reference}
		and has only gained widespread standardization in the last 5 years.
		There are still many inconsistencies, especially when tackling edge cases
		(for example the "Guillotine bug" in Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 and 7,
		each with their own variation
		\todo{http://www.positioniseverything.net/explorer/guillotine.html}).
		This technology stack and its edge cases is greatly reduced when
		on the server, because every software version and the software itself can
		be controlled by the developer.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Client side web applications}

These arguments do not make the case for a server-only web application.
They highlight the strengths of server side processing. A combination of
server-side and client-side processing where their respective advantages
are utilized and their drawbacks avoided, would in part help in creating
an optimal web application.

\todo{Explain why client side programming advantages are obvious.
The above is mainly done to draw lines in the sand, between client
and server side.}

\section{The development process}
The development process of a web application is similar to any other
software development process. One starts with the data to be modeled.
It may be developed for the client and server part simultaneously.
A protocol for communication between the two is then established.
The design of a web application is usually the last component to fall
into place. It may have existed in the very beginning of the development
process, but is usually only finished and implemented when most other critical
components are in place.

\subsection{Usual design patterns}
Design patterns help developers to organize software projects into agreed upon
components, where each component has a specific function
(also referred to as "concerns" or "responsibility").
Although their exact features may not be known when a developer is first
introduced to a new software project, design patterns help him to quickly
recognize where functionality may be located in the code.

Instead of requiring developers to think up new structures, Design patterns
also help developers with grouping new code into well known components.

We will focus on one specific design pattern in this thesis. There many others,
which are relevant in web application development. There is nonetheless one
prevalent design pattern which we will examine in the following.

\subsubsection{Model-View-Controller}
The Model-View-Controller design pattern has proven itself to be a sane
choice for developing web applications. Most frameworks today use this
pattern or variations thereof.
It lends itself very well to web applications because of the client server
model, components of this pattern can be present on both sides allowing the
structure to be homogeneous.

\begin{itemize}
	\item The "Model" part represents the "data". All dynamic parts of an
	application modify, create or delete data, however ephemeral this data may
	be. Since much of the data can grouped, because it belongs to the same
	entity, it makes sense to represent those entities in the code and
	attach the data to them. This constitutes a Model. Besides this data,
	the Model can also have functions attached to it, which can act upon the data
	in various ways.
	\item A "Controller" implements the business logic that is decoupled from one
	specific Model. It draws on the functions tied to the models to perform its
	duties. Both of these components may be present on the server as well
	as the client.
	\item This is true for the "View" component as well. Its purpose however only
	comes to fruition on the client. This component is present on both the server
	and the client. Any HTML the server sends to the client is considered part of
	the "View" component.\\
	The job of the "View" component is to present the data to the user and
	tie calls to the controller to elements of the interface that can be acted
	upon by the user.
\end{itemize}

Designs of web applications change with time, features are added or
removed and common processes simplified. In light of this, it is
desirable to ensure that the "View" part of the Model-View-Controller
pattern is easily modifiable.

Modifications of this pattern have evolved in the web application domain to
cater to this specific purpose. The most notable of those would be the
Model-View-ViewModel pattern. It was designed by Microsoft and targeted at
interface development platforms including Windows Presentation Foundation and
Silverlight but also HTML5.\todo{reference}

The "ViewModel" component allows developers to implement interface logic that
lies between the Model and the View, allowing the view to be entirely free
of code. This component is meant to hold data-bindings to the Model while
listening to interface events at the same time. It "translates" user actions
into operations on the Model. Without it, the view would have to be aware of how
data is laid out internally, making refactoring of code harder.

The advantage of this version of Model-View-Controller is the improved
separation of responsibility between interface developers and application
developers. Neither will be required to modify or thoroughly understand the code
of the other. Even if both roles are filled by the same person,
separation of responsibility in an application still has its merits.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\chapter{Tools of the trade}
In order to achieve a separation of responsibility various frameworks and tools
are at a developers disposal. In this thesis we will focus on two of them
specifically.
\section{Client frameworks}
\subsection{Backbone.js}
\subsection{XPath}
XPath is a language that allows us to define a path from a root node to another
node. Although limited, the language is fairly concise and directly built into
JavaScript. We will only be dealing with XPath 1.0, because version 2.0 is, with
the exception of Microsoft Internet Explorer, not implemented in any browsers
yet and likely will not ever be (the final specification was released 2006).
\section{Templating languages}
A templating language allows the developer to create HTML documents containing
placeholders, which later can be filled by a Model and its attributes.
Templating is part of the "View" component in the Model-View-Controller
pattern. In the following we will have a look at one such templating language.
\subsection{Mustache}
Mustache is a so called "logic-less" template engine.
This subtitle derives from the fact that there are no control flow statements
(e.g. if and else statements and while loops). Instead there are only tags.
Tags in in this context can be understood as an advanced form of placeholders.
Some tags are replaced with a string, some are replaced with nothing,
yet others are replace with series of strings or even more tags.
\subsubsection{Limitations}
\todo{fix entire paragraph}
These templating languages are very different in their design.
All aim to improve one or more aspects of the templating task.
Of those Mustache seems to be specifically tailored for web applications
with interactive JavaScript parts.
They all have a common trait which in some cases can be an advantage
but given any specific implementation of a web application is a drawback:
They are completely oblivious of their surroundings. They draw the line
at the "View" part in order to encourage a separation from the other
parts. This comes at the cost of lost information when sending a
rendered view to the client.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\chapter{Requirements}
The information lost after a view is rendered might not be useful and
the behavior of existing templating languages therefore inconsequential.
This is not the case. Let us consider a minimal template used for
displaying profile information:
\todo{\dots}
As you can see, the fields of the user object are printed into the HTML
at the appropriate places, leaving us with a normal page which can be
displayed in the browser.
Add the requirement that this form is not to be submitted via a
synchronous browser request but via AJAX. Now the developer has to
reverse engineer the generated HTML with JavaScript to obtain the
user information that is to be submitted. Any changes to the template
will now also require a change in client side code, particularly the
code, which finds the values in the form.
This example contains a rather obvious loss of information.
The position of the field attributes of the user object.
At the time of the rendering these positions are known, but as soon as the
result is converted into a string that is sent to the client, this
information is lost.

\todo{Introduction to what I want to do about it}

\section{Development workflow}
The tool introduced in this thesis, will be developed via an iterative
work flow. Two or three versions of the solution to the requirements outlined
above will be discussed in this thesis. Each version building on the knowledge
acquired in the development process of the previous.

\section{Initial prototype}
First a rudimentary prototype will be made. It is not very
useful in practice, but serves to illustrate the road map lying ahead.\\
This prototype is an exploratory prototype, meaning none of its code or
architecture is intended to make it into the next iteration. The motivation
behind this exercise was to simply explore what challenges lied ahead and to
explore the problem domain.

This prototype features an interactive application with which a movie
library can be maintained. Details can be edited and actors can be
added.
The server side back end is based on PHP and MySQL. The client side uses
HTML5, JavaScript (+XPath) and CSS as its core technologies.

\subsection{Libraries}
In order to speed up the prototyping process a plethora of libraries have been
used. Excluding basic core technologies like JavaScript, MySQL and PHP, the
application stack consists of the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{less}\\
	A superset of CSS providing variables, calculations and nested selectors. It
	is a javascript library which converts included less files into CSS.
	\item \emph{jQuery}\\
	The de facto standard when creating web applications. Among other things it
	simplifies the interaction with the DOM.
	\item \emph{underscore.js}\\
	Before jQuery was the standard prototype.js was a library developed by
	Sam Stephenson to improve upon the DOM API itself. It also brought with it
	various improvements to native JavaScript prototype objects. Underscore
	carries these improvements into the world of jQuery.
	\item \emph{backbone.js}\\
	Backbone.js is a JavaScript Model/View framework. It provides the developer
	with View, Model and Collection prototypes. The View prototype can be
	considered analogous to the aforementioned ViewModel, while the Model and
	Collection part make up the Model component and collections thereof
	respectively.
	\item \emph{php-activerecord}\\
	PHP ActiveRecord is the server side library utilized to communicate with the
	database.
	
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The application}
\todo{explaiiiin}
\subsection{Results}
\section{Plan for next iteration \todo{\dots}}
While developing this application various libraries have been examined for
their viability in the next iterations. backbone.js has in this case proven
itself to be a very good fit. Its View prototype is made to bind with the
interface while being Model aware. Such a component is what is needed to put the
information about the placement of data in the DOM to good use. Only small
modifications should be necessary to allow the View component to populate the
Model component with data from the DOM.
